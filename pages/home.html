                JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
                99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps.
                The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
                It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
            </p>
            <p>
                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
